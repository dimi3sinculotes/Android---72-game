# Android- 72-game

## It is an fast thinking game, inspired on base 12, where 72 is 60, you have one base12ish minute " " ", aka 72 seconds to do as many comparisons of >= as you can, random numbers in between 1 and 12 will appear all over the screen, in random spots, if you click over the one is greater or equal you get a point, how many points can you get in one minute?

### Notice that the upper and bottom bars will hide on your device, the reason why they appear here is because i need to open the upper android menu to take a screenshot
